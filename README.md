## blogs

This is the mini-blogging platform for our mini-blogs.

- [ok, ok, ok](https://ok.spacetypeco.com)

## Developing

You will need to have npm installed. I recommend a version manager like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).

Once you've got that ready, you can spin up local dev:

```sh
npm install && npm run dev
```

## High-Level Architecture

Foundations: Next.js 14, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, PostCSS (SASS support), SVGR

## Deployment

This repo automatically deploys to all blogs on push to main using Github Actions.
